# Advent of code 2023

This is the code for my solutions to the puzzles in [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), written in Python with the following objectives:

* Avoid using regular expressions unless necessary.
* Provide tests for each of the puzzles which check for the sample input and outputs.
* Use the standard library as much as possible instead of third party packages.
