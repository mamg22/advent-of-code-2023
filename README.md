# Advent of code 2023

This is the code for my solutions to the puzzles in [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), written in Python with the following objectives:

* Avoid using regular expressions unless necessary or when is the best option.
* Provide tests for each of the puzzles which check for the sample input and outputs.
* Prefer the standard library instead of third party packages.
* Try to write both readable and performant code as much as possible.
